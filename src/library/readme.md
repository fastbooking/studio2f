# Rojak: WordPress Theme Framework

Rojak is a framework for developing WordPress themes.  It allows theme developers to build themes without having to code much of the complex "logic" or other complicated functionality often needed in themes.  The framework takes care of a lot of these things so theme authors can get back to doing what matter the most:  developing and designing cool themes.

Rojak is mainly inspired by Hybrid Core. See Hybrid Core's readme to know more https://github.com/justintadlock/hybrid-core/blob/master/readme.md
